We were about to go rafting and I was walking in my wet suit through very cold water while it was very hot outside. My friends said that I just collapsed down and fell into the water. Last thing I remember was walking and then I just woke up on the river bank with everyone around me. I had blood coming out of my mount because I bit my tongue quite badly. I had no recollection of what happened and I was very confused and had no idea where I was or what year it is. Was taken to a hospital and they did an ecg and xray of my lungs and head and they also ran a blood test. Everything was in good order. The night before I didn't get the best sleep and we also drank a couple of beers.Fast-forward 2 years and 7 months, celebrating new year with my friends. I had just 1 beer and took a couple of puffs of weed. We had a long and good sleep and the next day we went on a little road trip. Everything was fine up until the evening. I was sitting on a couch and my friends said that I just let out a heavy suppressed scream and I collapsed on to the floor hitting my head on the corner of the table (still got a little scar). Woke up after 10 minutes confused AF because it felt like time travel. They took me to the hospital and I hot a CT scan of my head and urine an blood test and again everything was okay. The next day I went to a neurologist and he ordered an EEG after a sleepless night and an MRI and once again everything was totally fine. He das prescribed me 50mg of Lamotrigin to take in the morning and evening 25mg each (50mg in total).Now for almost 3 years I had no issues. Important to note that before the first seizure and after the first seizure I have experienced almost every epilepsy trigger multiple times. I went to rave parties and raved for 12 hours straight with flashing light while drunk and hungry. Listened to loud music, had sleepless nights, smoked week, have been blackout drunk amongst other things.So I am incredibly confused as to why have I collapsed twice in this 2,5 year period.Does this count as epilepsy?",

        "text": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on what you described and what might be going on. You might want to discuss these points with a neurologist for a more tailored answer. ### 1. **Epilepsy Diagnosis and Criteria** - Epilepsy is typically diagnosed after two or more unprovoked seizures (not caused by immediate triggers like fever, drugs, or withdrawal). - In your case, you had two unexplained 'seizure-like' episodes within a span of about 2.5 years, which might meet the criteria for epilepsy, even though the episodes were spread apart by a significant amount of time. - Your neurologist's decision to prescribe **Lamotrigine**, an anti-seizure medication, suggests they were leaning toward treating it as epilepsy. Lamotrigine is commonly used for focal (partial) or generalized epilepsy. ### 2. **Seizure Triggers vs. Random Occurrences** - Epileptic seizures are usually not predictable but may be triggered by specific things like sleep deprivation, alcohol, or stress. However, these triggers are inconsistent across individuals. The fact that you experienced many typical 'epilepsy triggers' without issues (like raves with flashing lights, sleepless nights, alcohol, etc.) doesn’t necessarily rule out epilepsy; it may just mean your threshold for having a seizure is generally high. - Your first episode occurred during a sudden and extreme temperature change (cold water while it was hot outside), which could have been a factor, but that alone doesn’t explain it fully. ### 3. **Types of Seizures** - Based on your descriptions, it sounds like you had **tonic-clonic seizures** (convulsive seizures with a loss of consciousness and body stiffening/jerking), as indicated by the tongue-biting, sudden collapse, and postictal confusion (disorientation after waking up). - Sometimes, tonic-clonic seizures don’t show up on standard EEGs, especially if the EEG is not done during an active episode or if you have focal epilepsy that only occasionally generalizes. ### 4. **Normal MRI and EEG Findings** - It’s common for people with epilepsy to have normal EEGs and MRIs, especially if their seizures are infrequent. EEGs only capture brain wave patterns during the recording time, so if you're not having a seizure or abnormal brain activity at that exact moment, the EEG can appear normal. - Similarly, MRIs are used to look for structural abnormalities (like tumors or lesions) that might be causing seizures. A normal MRI doesn’t rule out epilepsy; it just indicates there’s no obvious structural cause. ### 5. **Lamotrigine's Effectiveness** - The fact that you haven’t had another episode for three years while taking **Lamotrigine** could mean that the medication is effectively reducing your seizure threshold, preventing further episodes. This is sometimes seen as indirect confirmation that epilepsy is involved. - Lamotrigine is generally prescribed for long-term use in people diagnosed with epilepsy, even if seizures are infrequent, because there’s no way to predict when the next seizure might occur without the medication. ### 6. **Differential Diagnoses** - **Syncope (fainting):** Sometimes fainting episodes can resemble seizures, especially if there’s a brief period of convulsion or confusion afterward. However, syncope generally doesn’t cause tongue-biting or prolonged confusion, and people usually don’t injure themselves as severely as you did. - **Reflex anoxic seizures or convulsive syncope:** These are rare, seizure-like episodes triggered by sudden, intense stimuli (like cold water, pain, or stress). However, they’re more common in children than adults. - **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** These are seizure-like events without the electrical disturbances seen in epilepsy. However, PNES is usually more frequent than two events in 2.5 years and is often associated with specific triggers or stressors. PNES does not usually respond to anti-seizure medications. ### 7. **Is This Epilepsy?** - Given your history, it’s possible that you have a form of epilepsy with a high seizure threshold, meaning it takes a lot to provoke a seizure. It might be focal epilepsy, where seizures originate in a specific part of the brain and only occasionally spread, which could explain why they are rare and why the EEG didn’t pick them up. - While your episodes are infrequent, the fact that they are severe when they do happen (loss of consciousness, injury, tongue-biting, confusion) suggests that it’s safer to consider them as epileptic and continue taking anti-seizure medication. This is likely why your neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine despite the normal test results. ### Next Steps - **Follow-Up with a Neurologist:** Regular follow-ups with a neurologist are essential, especially if you’re questioning whether you need long-term medication. They might suggest a more prolonged EEG, possibly with video monitoring, to increase the chances of capturing any subtle seizure activity. - **Lifestyle Adjustments:** Even though you've managed to tolerate many typical seizure triggers without issues, it’s wise to be cautious with alcohol, sleep deprivation, and other potential triggers, just to lower any risk further. ### Final Thoughts Your episodes do seem consistent with epilepsy, especially given the type of events and your neurologist’s decision to prescribe Lamotrigine. However, because seizures have a wide range of presentations and can be difficult to diagnose definitively when they're rare, a cautious approach like medication and regular monitoring is typically the best course. If you continue to have no seizures on Lamotrigine for several years, your neurologist may eventually consider tapering you off, but that’s a decision they’d make based on your long-term history and any test results that arise in the future. It's a good idea to discuss your concerns and any other options with your neurologist to ensure you're on the right treatment path.",
